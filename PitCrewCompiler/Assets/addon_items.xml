		# FILE INFO #
			
			Do not be alarmed! This file has a lot of helpful friendly comments and info to help you. Please take the time to read and understand all this, as it's relatively simple!
			............................................................................................................................................................................
			
			This file contains information for the TCU Server about your addon items.
			You still have to modify the archetypes, server_archetypes and babdb files of your game install. (PitCrew makes it simple!)
			This is for the TCU Server to recognize your addon items and know what ID's and indexes they have.
			
			- The format follows that of the individual babdb's.
			- The price of the addon item is dictated by it's TypeId (The Item Pack it belongs to).
				- If it doesn't associate with a TypeId (ie car body or performance part items), a common price formula will be used.
			
			- You can use either normal decimals values, or hexadecimal values. Hexadecimal values MUST have prefix 0x. ( INCORRECT: 000000000793899C, CORRECT: 0x000000000793899C )
			- ALL hexadecimal values must be *Big Endian* Hexadecimal! You may be used to the FCB Converters' Little Endian Hex values (9F7BCB0600000000), Big Endian would be 0000000006CB7B9F.
			- HxD is highly recommended to easily deal with Hex values. You can use HxD or https://jmacwhyte.github.io/hexflip/ to flip endianness of Hex values.
			- Leading zeroes do not have to be preserved in Hex values. (For example: changing 0x000000000793899C to 0x793899C is completey fine.)
			- Hex values that are all FF's (FF - uint8, FFFF - uint16, FFFFFFFF - uint32, FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF - uint64) stand for "nothing".
				They can be simply replaced with blank (""), or the attribute can be avoided completely.
			
		# ITEM INDEXING #
			
			Render Parts and Physics (Performance) Parts *have* to be added into rendercarpartdb.bin & physcarpartdb.bin respectively (in road66database) for the game to know what their index is.
			The server and especially your savegame car datas use the item database index for all items instead of their 64 bit ID.
			Each item's database index is their index/position in rendercarpartdb/physcarpartdb (1st item being at index 0).
			
			As of The Crew 1.2.0.0 (latest version), there are a total of 11910 render car parts and 7260 phys car parts.
			This means the last render item's index is 11909 and last phys item's index is 7259 (because the 1st starts at index 0).
			The TCU Server and PitCrew are designed to append your addon items after the base game's last render/phys item, i.e. the first renderpart addon item's index would be 11910, 2nd would be 11911, and so on.
			
		# ITEM LEVEL #
			
			Item levels are pretty straight forward. "WhiteLevel" is a pre-calculated "worth" of the item based on level + quality.
			The formula for WhiteLevel is as follows: [ Level * Quality Level Coefficient ]. Level Coefficients per Quality ID are available below.
			
			CAULevel makes things a bit more complicated (because of it's sloppy implementation). CAULevel usually matches the Level value, until it goes above level 50.
			The Level value never goes above 50, but CAULevel does, so for example a level 60 part would have Level 50 & CAULevel 60. The absolute part level is the greater value of those 2.
			
		# PACK INDEX AND PRICING #
		
			.........................................
			... COLORS, STICKERS, INTERIORS, RIMS ...
			.........................................
				
				Internally, the server_archetypes contain a ton of different item packs that the game's interface doesn't distinguish between.
				For example: the "Urban" Item Type/category of stickers would contain stickers from several different sticker packs, however the interface just shows them all under "Urban" (1 and 2).
				
				You may notice stickers (and other visual items like color, rims, interiors) have different prices, even if they're within the same category (Item Type).
				That is decided by a field in each item pack called "AbilityToComputePrice". It dictates which "Tuner Zone" price you're paying for this item (in any Tuner shop).
				
				Babdb entries must specify this via the "PackIndex" parameter, the values are as following:
				 - CAbility_CarTuner_Street = 0x0000001C
				 - CAbility_CarTuner_Dirt = 0x0000001D
				 - CAbility_CarTuner_Perf = 0x0000001E
				 - CAbility_CarTuner_Raid = 0x0000001F
				 - CAbility_CarTuner_Circuit = 0x00000020
				For example, the "Urban" sticker category/Item Type has the following pricing per "Tuner Zone" (also defined in server_archetypes):
				 - CAbility_CarTuner_Street (0x0000001C) = 9000
				 - CAbility_CarTuner_Dirt (0x0000001D) = 9000
				 - CAbility_CarTuner_Perf (0x0000001E) = 10000
				 - CAbility_CarTuner_Raid (0x0000001F) = 10000
				 - CAbility_CarTuner_Circuit (0x00000020) = 11000
				 
				Set your PackIndex in the babdb entry (and matching item entry above) according to the AbilityToComputePrice field of the item pack you put your item into in server_archetypes.
				
				
				### Simple Addon Sticker example ###
				
				Let's say you want to add a new addon sticker into the "Urban" sticker category with Street Tuner prices.
				 - Find a StickerPack entity that contains Urban-Item Type stickers, with the StickerPack's AbilityToComputePrice set to CAbility_CarTuner_Street.
				 - Assign a PackIndex of 0x0000001C to your new sticker item babdb entry (and also in the items node above).
			 
			.........................................
			... CAR BODY PARTS, PERFORMANCE PARTS ...
			.........................................
				
				These kinds of items use a different pricing formula. In server_archetypes, you can find "Zone Prices" per Tuner (Start Price, End Price):
				 - Steet: 	(450, 1600)							[Start Level: 1]
				 - Dirt:	(1125, 3400)						[Start Level: 10]
				 - Perf:	(2200, 5400)						[Start Level: 20]
				 - Raid:	(3700, 7400)						[Start Level: 30]
				 - Circuit:	(6000, 9000)						[Start Level: 40]
				 - Monster, Drift, Dragster same as Circuit.	[Start Level: 40]
				 
				These define the price range of car body parts and performance parts.
				- Start Price is the price for a [Start]-Level item (i.e. Level 10 at the Dirt Tuner), and End Price is the price for a Level 50 item (max level before the CAU DLC).
				- For all item levels in between [Start] and 50, the price is interpolated. For levels above 50, it's extrapolated past the End price.
				- The final price is then multiplied by the Quality Ratio (found below) based on the item's QualityID.
				
				# FORMULA PSEUDO-CODE #
					int ItemLevel = ... 				// max of (Level, CAULevel)
					float QualityRatio = ...			// Quality Ratio for this item's Quality ID (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum).
					int StartLevel = ...				// Tuner Start Level)
					int EndLevel = 50;					// Always 50
					
					float PriceAlpha = (ItemLevel - StartLevel - 1)  /  (EndLevel - StartLevel - 1);	// Un-interp function: (value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value).
					float Price = lerp(StartPrice, EndPrice, PriceAlpha);								// Any normal lerp/linear interpolation function.
					int FinalPrice = floor(Price * QualityRatio);
				###
				
				NOTE: For some reason, despite defining various item Levels for *car body parts*, they're always priced at Start prices only. The TCU Server is designed to match this behavior.


	Add your addon items into the <renderparts> or <physparts> nodes at the top of the file, depending on which part db you want to use (render/phys).
	The ordering of items in each parts node matters!
	
	Available item types:
	 - "color" 				| 	id (uint64), Type (uint32(hash)), ModelId (uint64), PackIndex (uint32), TypeId (uint64)
	 - "sticker" 			| 	id (uint64), Type (uint32(hash)), ModelId (uint64), PackIndex (uint32), TypeId (uint64)
	 - "rim"				|	id (uint64), Type (uint32(hash)), ModelId (uint64), PackIndex (uint32), TypeId (uint64)
	 - "carinteriorpattern"	|	id (uint64), Type (uint32(hash)), ModelId (uint64), PackIndex (uint32), TypeId (uint64), OnlyStitches (bool)
	 - "licenseplate"		|	id (uint64), Type (uint32(hash)), TypeId (uint64)
	 - "driverhelmet"		|	id (uint64), ModelID (uint64), DriverID (uint64), PackIndex (uint32), Type (uint32(hash)), TypeId (uint64), NetworkChunck (uint32(hash))
	 - "driversuit"			|	id (uint64), ModelID (uint64), SlotID (uint64), DriverID (uint64), PackIndex (uint32), Type (uint32(hash)), TypeId (uint64), NetworkChunck (uint32(hash))
	 - "item"				|	id (uint64), Level (uint8), ModelID (uint64), QualityID (uint64), DressID (uint64), SlotID (uint64), NetworkChunk (uint32(hash)), RimPackIndex (uint32), TypeID (uint64), WhiteLevel (float32), AccelBonus (uint8), TopSpeedBonus (uint8), HandlingBonus (uint8), BrakingBonus (uint8), CAULevel (uint8)
	
	Disambiguation:
	 - "id": The Entity ID of your archetype.
	 - "PackIndex": Used to specify AbilityToComputePrice of the respective Item Pack this item is part of (in server_archetypes). More info above at the "PACK INDEX AND PRICING" chapter.
	 - "TypeId": The Item Type of this item. Alternatively, think of it as the category of item. You can find Item Type IDs for each... kind of item (color/sticker/interior/rim etc) below!
	 - "Type": CRC32 hash of the name of the Type ID, for example: color type 65CEBC8E would link to "_root.$Official_f", and subsequently it's color type entity in archetypes. [Inconsequential to TCU Server]
	 - "Level": Level of the item, ranging from 1 to 50. If you want to set the item level above 50, use:
	 - "CAULevel": Must match "Level" until level 50. After 50 it can go higher.
	 - "WhiteLevel": Worth of the item based on it's level and quality. More in-depth explanation at the start of this file.
	 - "ModelID": Model ID of the car this item is for exclusively. Use "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF" (which is -1 as a signed 64 bit integer) to make it universal for all cars.
	 - "DressID": Same as Model ID but for the dress (spec) of the car. I believe using "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF" would also make it universal.
	 - "QualityID": ID of the quality of this item (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum). Quality IDs can be found below.
	 - "SlotID": ID of the car part slot that this item goes into. Slot IDs can be found below.
	
	Examples with each kind of item:
	 - <color id="0x0000000000E618FA" Type="0x65CEBC8E" ModelId="0x000000000037569A" PackIndex="0x1C" TypeId="0x0000000006CB7B9F"/>

	 - <driversuit id="0x000000000793899C" ModelID="0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF" SlotID="0x000000000793AE54" DriverID="0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF" PackIndex="0xFFFFFFFF" Type="0x9410B07" TypeId="0x0000000007941234" NetworkCnuck="0x8D5AE7E8"/>
	 - <item id="0x00000000078484D5" Level="1" ModelID="0x0000000000375699" QualityID="0x0000000000B9FE99" DressID="0x0000000000375696" SlotID="0x0000000000B9FE8D" NetworkChunk="0x166B8E90" RimPackIndex="0x1D" TypeID="0x0000000007847356" WhiteLevel="1.0" AccelBonus="0" TopSpeedBonus="0" HandlingBonus="0" BrakingBonus="0" CAULevel="1"/>
	
	Note: the <item> kind of item may go in either the renderpart or physpart db, based on what they are.
	 - Performance parts (with a physpart slot ID, list found below) go into physparts!
	 - Visual Car body parts go into renderparts!
