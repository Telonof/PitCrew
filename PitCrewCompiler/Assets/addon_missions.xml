		# FILE INFO #
			
			This file contains basic information for the TCU Server about your addon missions.
			This information is needed for the TCU Server to recognize the missions when you play them and correctly process the rewards.
			
			You still have to modify the missionspawners.entities.bin file, otherwise they won't appear ingame!
			
			- You can use either normal decimals values, or hexadecimal values. Hexadecimal values MUST have prefix 0x. ( INCORRECT: 000000000793899C | CORRECT: 0x000000000793899C )
			- ALL hexadecimal values must be *Big Endian* Hexadecimal! You may be used to the FCB Converters' Little Endian Hex values (9F7BCB0600000000), Big Endian would be 0000000006CB7B9F.
			- HxD is highly recommended to easily deal with Hex values. You can use HxD or https://jmacwhyte.github.io/hexflip/ to flip endianness of Hex values.
			- Leading zeroes do not have to be preserved in Hex values. (For example: changing 0x000000000793899C to 0x793899C is completey fine.)
			- Hex values that are all FF's (FF - uint8, FFFF - uint16, FFFFFFFF - uint32, FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF - uint64) stand for "nothing".
				They can be simply replaced with blank (""), or the attribute can be avoided completely.
			
			
		# MISSION REWARDS #
			
			RewardValuesID links to the CITEntityRewardValues entity (can be found in archetypes.entities.bin) that defines the reward multipliers.
			RewardValues IDs can be found below for each type of Mission.
			
			- Story Missions use the MaxLevel as the factor for rewards.
			- Faction Missions & CAU Missions use Player Level as the factor for rewards.
			
			
		# MISSION LEVEL #
			
			DelockLevel defines which level the player has to reach to unlock (and therefore be able to play) this mission.
			MaxLevel is the Mission Level, which will affect the Bucks & XP pay for Story Missions.
			
			
		# SCORE OBJECTIVES #
			
			Objectives define the threshold for the Mission Score you're supposed to surpass for each Medal (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum).
			Faction Missions do not have Score Objectives and do not reward Medals.
			
			
		# GAMEPLAY ZONE #
			
			Assigned only for Faction Missions, this defines which one of the 5 regions this mission takes place in.
			When you beat a Faction Mission, you are rewarded Reputation. Rep is (usually) earned by region, so this defines which region you've earned Rep for.
			
			Gameplay Region indexes are as follows:
			 - 0 = None (Rep will be rewarded for you, but won't be attributed to any specific region)
			 - 1 = Midwest
			 - 2 = East Coast
			 - 3 = The South
			 - 4 = Mountain States
			 - 5 = West Coast
