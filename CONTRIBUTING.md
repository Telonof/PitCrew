PR's are accepted. The only thing asked is given a reason as to why your PR exists and I'll review accordingly.

## Languages

Languages are always welcome! They does not require reasoning in your PR.

To begin, copy and paste ``English.json`` found in ``Languages``, rename it to the language you'll be translating it to and edit any value inside the JSON.

Once complete, submit a PR with your new JSON inside the ``Languages`` folder.
